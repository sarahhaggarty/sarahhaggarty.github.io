# Managing the Customer Relationship – Embedded Firmware Delivery

As a Product Owner and Engineering Manager that's managed embedded firmware delivered to millions of devices globally, I've had the opportunity to be both the customer and the supplier in two different industries. I've experienced first hand the difficulty each faces when it comes to embedded firmware delivery and I know how important it is for both parties to get it right. To have a successful product you need to have successful firmware and this depends more than you would realise on a successful relationship between customer and supplier. 

In the below article I've highlighted **"The Fundamental Six"** that are common pitfalls you can make as a supplier when trying to manage the customer relationship. It’s all about trust and there are a number of things you can do as a supplier to work towards fostering a healthy relationship between customer and supplier or better yet, creating a partnership.

## The Fundamental Six:

### 1. Communicate Clearly

**Be honest.** Admit what you do know and what you don’t. And whatever you do, don’t improvise an answer on the fly. If you do this you risk looking unprofessional and disorganised. If you don't know something it is far better to accept the task of finding an answer than guessing and getting it wrong. 

How to communicate successfully in an influential and persuasive way that engenders trust will depend on the culture of the customer you are working with. If you want to learn more about this, I recommend Erin Meyer’s book: The Culture Map. In it, she compares countries on eight different scales to show how differences in cultural approach can lead to conflict. With awareness of where you are as a supplier on these scales and where your customer is, you can get the most out of your communication and relationship building.

### 2. Don't Overshare

You want the customer to feel involved and informed but you need to prevent them from becoming a bottleneck. If they are overwhelmed with information then they can’t give the timely feedback that you need. If you share too much it takes more time for the customer to review. More questions need to be answered about things that have no effect on them which takes time away from the actual work. 

Be mindful also that the more information you share the higher the bar you are setting to share that level of information forevermore. You did it once? Why can’t you do it again? Make sure you have either the tools in place to make this effortless or resources available to handle the administration work so you can remain looking competent and in control. 

### 3. Breathe

The faster and more chaotic things get the more important it is to breathe through the situation. 

I originally learned this as part of one of my hobbies: ballet. When dancing ballet you need to have considerable coordination to move your arms, legs and head independently simultaneously and all in time to the music. This can become overwhelming quickly at speed but the simple act of breathing deeply allows you more time between each step. This same technique can be applied here.

In a firmware world, what I'm about to say could be controversial for some, but here goes: 

>If a critical issue pops up, don’t pick up the phone to the customer straight away.

 Always fact-check first, unless you have a very good professional relationship with them. 

The reason why I say this is because the issue could be anything; from a lab environment problem, human error, misunderstanding of requirements or a corner case of a corner case of a corner case. 

It’s even more important if the issue is end customer or operations impacting to get as much information as you can before raising the alarm. I'm not saying to sit on it for days but in the majority of cases you can take 24-48 hours to understand whether this is something to hit the red button for. And if it is, you can then brief the customer with your justification for that and have a timeline ready for your planned next steps to get their feedback. 

Obviously, the closer you are to a delivery date the more time sensitive it becomes but I would argue even more strongly that it is then more important to double-check your facts. 

I remember sitting as a customer with a supplier in Taiwan on a status update call when one of the supplier’s project managers came in saying that they’d just found a critical bug that was crashing the firmware. As a result, our project timelines would be impacted. Immediately my manager that was on the phone was demanding information as to the nature of the issue but there was no information yet. It circled like this for several minutes with increasing levels of concern before I stepped in stating that we needed to park this discussion and reconvene at the end of the day when there was more information available. 

This was the perfect example of raising an issue too soon.

### 4. Use the Power of: No

There are a lot of believers in the saying: “the customer is always right,” but some customers are not always reasonable. 

Customers can ask for commitments to things that they know a supplier **can’t** commit to delivering. Sometimes the reason for this can be political. For example, you must commit to delivering 100% bug free firmware or you must commit to root cause an issue within a certain time frame. 

Although saying yes to demands such as these may give a short term happiness boost to the customer, when you don’t deliver on that commitment it only lands you in a worse situation than you were before. You need to be clear on your limitations and ready to discuss options if the customer wants to try and change these. 

However, sometimes the answer just has to be: no. 

### 5. Stay Disciplined

If you've ever been to the London Underground you will have seen that despite the high frequency of underground trains there are always those who will try to jump on board within the last few seconds of departure as the door is closing. The doors have an automatic mechanism to open if they trap a person or object whilst closing. If this mechanism is triggered repeatedly then inevitably the train is delayed which has a knock-on effect to the train behind it and the train behind that one and so on. And this is all because some people can't wait the 2 or 3 minutes for the next one to arrive. This same behaviour is also common when it comes to embedded firmware delivery.

In embedded firmware the delivery schedule is a challenge and if you’re lucky you can deliver a new firmware release on a weekly basis, perhaps even more frequently than that. If you’re unlucky and don’t have tools in place to allow for firmware development and testing to be completed in parallel and in a short time frame then often your deliveries are monthly, quarterly or even yearly. This means that when you’re getting closer to the point of no return you always need to be prepared for the last minute requests for content change. 

The concern here is always that if the customer waits for these last minute requests in the following release then it could be “like **FOREVER**” before they will be able to deploy it. 

The key here is to have a regular release cadence that works like clockwork to give the customer the comfort that even if they miss this one then the next is only (a week, two weeks, a month) away. With quarterly release cadence this becomes more difficult but it is then even more important. 

Towards the end of a release, time should be spent solely on bug fixing and not on adding new feature content or significant functional change last minute as this increases the risk of regression and can ultimately lead the customer to having to wait just as long for the current release as compared to waiting for the next. 

The best approach to avoid this is that when the current release development is progressing, actively engage the customer on the content for the next release early which will focus them on the future rather than make them feel like they are walking up to a cliff edge. 

Convince them that waiting 2 to 3 minutes is worth it.

### 6. Don’t Run Faster Than You Can Walk

There is always pressure as a supplier to deliver more content, faster and to a higher quality. The same can be said for even simple information requests. The desire to please the customer can lead to providing answers/commitments/decisions without due diligence with the relevant stakeholders internally or externally. 

Make sure you have time set aside for internal alignment. There’s nothing worse than discussing and aligning in front of the customer. 

When being requested for information as the supplier you have the power when to share and how much   
(see: [Don't Overshare](#dont-overshare)). It is always better to delight by delivering more than anticipated rather than to overcommit and underdeliver. 

If you can reach the goldilocks stage of delivering just the right content at just the right time as planned then even better. But be wary that once it is seen that a delivery schedule or process starts working, the demands on that schedule/process will significantly increase. 

Stick to what you know you can do well.
