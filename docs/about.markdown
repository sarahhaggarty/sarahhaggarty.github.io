# About

I’m passionate about technology and sharing new ideas and concepts in a clear and interesting way. I revel in the activity of breaking down a complex topic to make it accessible and understandable to a wider audience. 

Where most engineers dread to put words to paper I receive immense satisfaction from it. After all, a tool or technology is only useful if it can be easily understood and used. 

Over my career across telecommunication and automotive industries, I’ve written hundreds of technical documents from requirements and specifications to test cases to reports to solution and interaction designs.

I have a strong technical and product background with considerable experience in managing firmware for product launches, hardware updates and third party agent integrations. I'm a specialist in extracting information from a variety of different stakeholders to create the documentation that is needed while building a good rapport.

I’ve decided to step back from a leadership and product focussed role to take time to develop my creative skills and extend my technical skillset while dedicating quality time to spend with my loved ones.
